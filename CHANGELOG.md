# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (2026-09-27)

- Redesign settings with separate Controls and App tabs, compact grouped rows and category filters.
- Add a live enabled count and a clear paused state. Keep all patch selections and saved preferences.
- Match the new dark and light layouts with shared colors, rectangular switches and readable section headings.
- Keep appearance, version details and setup help together in the App tab.
- Preserve the selected tab, category, search and scroll position when changing themes. Keep 48 dp touch targets and adapt the header to narrow screens or larger text.
- Pass all 57 local tests and Android lint. Rebuild both supported APKs with all 21 patches and verify their v3 signatures. Compare both settings pages against the design references on an isolated S22 display.

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-27)

- Replace the two-entry catalog with 21 selectable patches. Each feature applies independently and shares one settings extension.
- Add 13 optional controls: inbox ad filtering, People You May Know, friend request cards, growth prompts, Chat Moments, AI sticker tools, avatar stickers, inbox promotions, chat promotions, business reply suggestions, business typing suggestions, event prompts and the Reels badge.
- Extend the existing Meta AI control to the inbox toolbar button.
- Add settings search and show only installed controls. Saved choices survive removing and later adding a patch.
- Preserve stock behavior while switches are off or changes are paused. Check exact hook sets and the new plugin gates' disabled branches before patching.
- Add regression tests for separate selection, capability metadata, search and ad-filter return branches. Existing tests remain intact.
- Pass 26 Kotlin, 15 Android and 11 Python tests, Android lint, both full APK rebuilds and a separate single-control rebuild. Exercise settings search, persistence and themes on an isolated S25 display.
- Refresh the remote source on S22 and S25 and verify all 21 entries in each phone's catalog. Keep their installed Messenger apps intact.
- Keep the ad filter experimental. No affected-account ad row was available for a live removal check. Original-package startup remains unresolved.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-27)

- Add seven optional controls adapted from existing Messenger patches: stories and notes, inbox tabs, Facebook shortcuts, Meta AI buttons, external web links, typing signals and bubble eligibility. All switches start off.
- Add a HushMessenger settings launcher entry with saved switches, a pause control and a light theme. Inbox changes take effect after reopening Messenger.
- Check the complete hook set on both supported 580 APKs. Changed hooks stop patching rather than silently skipping a feature.
- Verify the settings screen, light theme, pause and Messenger launch on an isolated S25 diagnostic copy. Stories, the Facebook toolbar shortcut and the Meta AI floating button passed before/after checks. The original-package startup failure remains unresolved.
- Pass 20 patch, nine Android settings and 11 certificate tests. Both exact APKs patch and sign successfully.
- Verify the v0.1.0 remote source and both patch entries on S22 and S25. Their stock Messenger installations and sign-ins stayed intact.
- Correct the remote index timestamp for Manager's local date-time parser. The bundle download and checksum are unchanged.
- Add bytecode and Android settings tests. Keep ad blocking and media transcoding unavailable until their current paths can be verified.

## 0.0.9 (2026-09-27)

- Add a read-only installation check that verifies APK certificates and reports installed-app or permission-owner conflicts before any device changes. It checks the phone's current signer set, including API-specific rotation and multiple signers, and refuses uncertain results.
- Cover the check with eleven Python tests and exercise it against the S25's installed apps, including a deliberately mismatched signing fixture.
- Confirm stock encrypted message delivery between two owned accounts on S22 and S25. The S22's stock browser switch passed HTTP and HTTPS comparisons; its original setting was restored. Re-signed Messenger still needs a working startup path.

## 0.0.8 (2026-09-27)

- Record the S25 test: a same-key patched Messenger installed, but its first-run screen stayed blank. An unchanged APK rebuilt and signed through the same tool did the same.
- Clarify the phone-data warning after reinstalling the original stock APK required a fresh sign-in. Chats, calls and notifications remain unverified.

## 0.0.7 (2026-09-27)

- Record the S22 stock Messenger controls for inbox suggestions, external links, notifications, chat heads and accessibility without changing account settings.
- Refine patch plans around the controls Messenger already provides, including checks that would justify a separate browser or suggestions patch.
- Rebuild the preview bundle and repeat the S22 off-device patch, signature and changed-APK checks.

## 0.0.6 (2026-09-27)

- Add the S25's Messenger 580 arm64 build to the exact compatibility list after comparing its APK with the S22 fixture.
- Verified that altered permission bytecode in either APK stops patching before an output is written.
- Left both phones' installed Messenger apps and local chat data untouched.

## 0.0.5 (2026-09-27)

- Add a repeatable changed-APK check that confirms Morphe stops before rebuilding when permission bytecode differs from the tested Messenger build.
- Ignore local signing keys and Python cache files so they cannot be staged by accident.
- Explain that Manager and Desktop currently load patch bundles without verifying the source index's detached-signature URL.
- Keep device-dependent patch work in a blocked tracker until an isolated signed-in arm64 session can verify it.

## 0.0.4 (2026-09-27)

- Put the tested APK and phone-data warning before the preview setup steps.
- Make the README easier to use on a phone, including a copyable stock APK checksum and recovery help.
- Move the support link below the setup and verification details.
- Give patch failures the exact Messenger build needed to retry with an unmodified APK.
- Shorten the patch and source descriptions and cover the recovery message in ten unit tests.
- Check both Manager 1.32.0 source methods and the published source in Morphe Desktop 1.17.0.

## 0.0.3 (2026-09-27)

- Reject Messenger builds whose shared-permission manifest counts, component owners or active DEX instruction sites differ from the checked 580 APK.
- Add regression tests for missing or reassigned guards, duplicate declarations and changed DEX sites.
- Use the smali revision requested by Morphe Patcher 1.14.1.
- Give the patch bundle a fixed release timestamp so clean builds have the same checksum.
- Lock build dependencies and verify their artifact hashes, including the Morphe build plugin.
- Explain how to load a preview source in Morphe Manager and Desktop.

## 0.0.2 (2026-09-27)

- Published the Messenger patch source with a README hero, icon and social preview in the Hush project style.
- Added a Morphe source index and a preview bundle for the exact Messenger 580 arm64 target.
- Rebuilt the bundle locally, applied it to a stock APK copy and verified the signed output off-device.
- Documented the signing-key requirement and the remaining phone checks.

## 0.0.1 (2026-09-27)

- Started a separate local Morphe patch source for Messenger `580.0.0.49.91` (arm64, version code `346013387`).
- Added a shared-permission rename patch for installation beside Meta apps.
- Added the project research, roadmap, build notes and GPL attribution.
